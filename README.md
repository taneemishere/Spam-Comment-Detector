# Spam-Comment-Detector
A Machine Learning Application that when you provide a comment and in return it predicts you whether it is spam or not.
This will going to be a full fledge application that will has a proper front and back end. 

## The Application
The appplication works as to catch the text or more specifically the comments from an HTML form, entered by the user. 
Then that text will be goin to the Machine Learning Model that is trained, and so that model will 
predict the comment as spam or not spam(Ham). The Ham word I first read in the book 
"Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python A Test-Driven Approach" by Matthew Kirk in O'REILLY Series, while 
reading the Naive Bayes Classification chapter.
